This project is an example of UITextView that changes in height dynamically when you enter text on the textView. 
The parent UIView also change in size with the textView height change. This is done with storyboard constraints.

How to use:
Just do the constraints as they are in the project
Make sure to uncheck "Scrolling Enabled" for the UITextView
This makes the UITextView aware of its contents
